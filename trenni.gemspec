	Trenni is a templating system built on top of SGML/XML. It uses efficient
	native parsers where possible and compiles templates into efficient Ruby.
	
	In addition, Trenni includes an SGML/XML builder to assist with the generation
	of pleasantly formatted markup which is compatible with the included parsers.
